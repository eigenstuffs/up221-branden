--------

This is my repo for a graduate course on GIS and Spatial Data Science (URBN PL 221) at UCLA, for the Winter 2024 quarter.
I am an undergraduate senior, studying Political Science and Statistics at UCLA, and am largely taking this course due to an
interest in formal Python training and to expand my knowledgebase on quantitative methods.
