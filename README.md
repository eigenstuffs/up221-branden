This is my repo for a graduate course on GIS and Spatial Data Science (URBN PL 221) at UCLA, for the Winter 2024 quarter.
I am an undergraduate senior, studying Political Science and Statistics at UCLA, and am largely taking this course due to an
interest in formal Python training and to expand my knowledgebase on quantitative methods.


I have substantial experience in R for all stages of the data analysis pipeline, with substantive training in econometrics.
My proposed project is inspired by [Leah Stokes' great 2016 natural experiment](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12220),
where she finds evidence for electoral backlash affecting incumbent politicans in response to a wind energy program. I hope
to create a similar project, instead finding areas with the greatest disparities in wind energy potential and wind energy
development. I am curious as to whether the hypothesis holds that wealthier and heavily white areas are the ones with the greatest
disparities in wind energy potential and realization. I also want to include independent variables such as the ideology of
the legislative representatives, the unionization rate, the poverty rate, and the median home value, as well as the ethnic
composition. I hope that this research can further nuance our understanding of political obstacles to clean energy development.
